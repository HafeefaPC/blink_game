## Project Description
The Blink Game is an interactive challenge where participants try to keep their eyes open as long as possible while staring at their opponent. The game tracks the time until the first blink, promoting fun and friendly competition.

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)
What if staring contests could be more exciting? Introducing the Blink Game: because why let a simple stare-off be boring when you can make it a thrilling digital showdown!

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)
With the Blink Game, players can create teams, set a number of tries, and engage in blink battles. Participants enter their names and team names, and when the game starts, it tracks how long they can keep their eyes open without blinking. The longer they last, the more glory they achieve, complete with virtual confetti when they win!
